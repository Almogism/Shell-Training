## How to Verify Your Work:

1. **Write your script** to transform the file
2. **Make it executable**: `chmod +x scriptX.sh`
3. **Run your script**: `./scriptX.sh`
4. **Check the result**: `cat filename.txt`
5. **Compare** with the expected output

## Simple Commands Reference:
- `sort filename` - Sort lines alphabetically
- `nl filename` - Add line numbers
- `tr 'a' 'b'` - Replace character 'a' with 'b'
- `grep "pattern"` - Keep lines matching pattern
- `grep -v "pattern"` - Remove lines matching pattern
- `wc -l` - Count lines
- `echo "text" >>` - Append text to file
- `sed 's/old/new/g'` - Replace old with new

## Important Pattern:
Always use temporary files when modifying:
```bash
command input.txt > temp.txt && mv temp.txt input.txt
```
